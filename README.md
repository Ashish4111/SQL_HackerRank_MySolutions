# SQL_HackerRank_MySolutions
My Solutions to the SQL questions from Hacker Rank 

Hello Data professional, 

Please allow me to introduce myself, I am Ashish working as a Technical Business/Data Analyst in a leading Australian bank. I use SQL as one of my tool to perform my day to day tasks for data transformations, data analysis, data cleansing, data wrangling, data profiling etc. to get some meaningful insights from our DWH. 

I have curated this Public github repository to organise my solutions to the SQL problems in Hacker Rank which helped me to bag a gold badge (5*).
